This plugin will simply allow you to point to a page to serve up if you get a 404 error. Also it marks it as 404.

== Description ==

Why choose this plugin?

* 404 pages not working? 
* Would you like to have a custom 404 page? 
* Would you like the 404 page to be a static page? 
* Do you need to have a Wordpress CMS page as your 404 page?

This plugin does it!

This a rebel plugin that does not use Wordpress's 404 hook. It was developed for themes or plugins that cause issues with the hook itself.

For more information see FAQ page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Under Settings > 404 Settings Enter full URL of page you want the 404 page to show. Can be a html page!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the response of the 404 become a 302 or 301? =

No, we keep the response to 404, so that search engines know.

= Can I change the response to be a 301 or 302? =

Currently not. We hope to have this in a later version.

= Any bugs? =

Update to the latest version.

No reports on any bugs.
Theoretically untested bug:
* Dynamic login information may not show up on the 404 page. 
Because this is untested, I am unsure if this causes an issue or not. If it does, add a support topic so I can test for you.

== Screenshots ==

1. Under Settings > 404 Settings. Add a URL to show as your 404 page. If blank, you can edit the HTML page and serve that as your 404 page.
2. The default HTML 404 Page
